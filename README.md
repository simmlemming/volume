# Volume
An app that controls volume when playing music in the car: the faster you go the louder the music is.

## Features
* Designed to be invisible:
  * Start automatically when selected bluetooth device connects.
  * Stops automatically when headphones disconnect.
* Works with bluetooth and 3.5 mm "jack" outputs.
* Has a homepage widget to quickly start/stop it manually.

* Keeps track of noise level in the car.
* Speed thresholds can be adjusted manually.

P. S. Has an ~~ugly~~ _minimalistic_ UI, any contributions are welcomed.
